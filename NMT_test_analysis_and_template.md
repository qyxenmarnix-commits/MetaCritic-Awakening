## 7. COMMON PITFALLS & HOW TO AVOID THEM

### Pitfall 1: Ambiguous Questions
**Problem**: "What is the best explanation?"
**Solution**: Define "best" - most comprehensive? Most concise? Most accurate?

### Pitfall 2: Unbalanced Difficulty
**Problem**: All easy or all hard questions
**Solution**: Use 70-20-10 rule (70% standard, 20% challenging, 10% advanced)

### Pitfall 3: Trick Questions
**Problem**: Designed to confuse rather than assess
**Solution**: Questions should test knowledge, not reading traps

### Pitfall 4: No Clear Rubric
**Problem**: Subjective grading leads to inconsistency
**Solution**: Explicit criteria for each point value

### Pitfall 5: Cultural Bias
**Problem**: Questions assume specific cultural knowledge
**Solution**: Use universal examples or provide context

## 11. EXPERT RECOMMENDATIONS

### From Assessment Design Expert
"The key to world-class tests is **clarity of purpose**. Every question should map to a specific learning objective. Avoid 'filler' questions that don't meaningfully assess understanding."

### From Pedagogical Strategist  
"Balance is everything. Tests should challenge without discouraging. Aim for 70% of students achieving 70-80% scores - this indicates appropriate difficulty calibration."

### From Equity & Access Specialist
"Cultural neutrality doesn't mean cultural erasure. Use diverse examples and provide context. Ensure all students have equal opportunity to demonstrate knowledge."

### From Technical Editor
"Clarity in language prevents misinterpretation. Use simple, direct sentences. Avoid nested clauses and jargon unless testing that specific vocabulary."
